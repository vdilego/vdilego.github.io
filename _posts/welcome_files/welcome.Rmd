Hello, and welcome to my blog!

## Introduction

In my series of posts, I will explore themes I find interesting, in the intersection of demography, social and medical sciences, mathematics, policy relevant issues and much more. This is a personal view and space to connect the dots and my ecclectic taste! A bit of literature, music and food will have some space too. After all, they are the spice of life. Hope you enjoy!

Follow me as well on [**my professional page**](http://www.wittgensteincentre.org/en/staff/member/di-lego.htm), [**github**](https://github.com/vdilego) and [**\@v_dilego**](https://twitter.com/v_dilego).


## Some R pain as well

I will also share some R pain trajectories and other nerdy enterprises. I have been exploring a lot the connections of [{xaringan}](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) and other resources.
