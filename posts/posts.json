There is a huge debate on this and currently the axis Roger Federer - Rafael Nadal - Novak Djokovic is the most celebrated of the GOAT. To create the sticker, I wanted to make a stlyzed graph that reflected the relationship between tournament type and each player. This is because there is widespread consensus that Nadal is best in Clay courts while Djokovic is best in Slow hard courts and Federer in hard and fast courts (see discussion here). In a way, they are GOATS of their courts. But there is a debate on this point.\r\nUsing the data on the top winners of all time in 2017 we recreated the sticker using the following code, adapated from here :\r\n\r\n\r\n# top 4 winners\r\n\r\nslam_top_chart$WINNER <- factor(slam_top_chart$WINNER, levels = slam_top_chart$WINNER[order(slam_top_chart$NUM_WINS)])\r\ntop_winners_gt4 <- slam_top_chart %>%\r\n  filter(NUM_WINS >= 4)\r\n\r\n# top winners by player and tournament\r\nslam_top_chart_by_trn <-slam_win %>%\r\n  filter(WINNER %in% top_winners_gt4$WINNER) %>%\r\n  group_by(TOURNAMENT, WINNER) %>%\r\n  summarise(NUM_WINS=n()) %>%\r\n  arrange(desc(NUM_WINS))\r\n\r\n# ploting top 10\r\nslam_top_chart_by_trn$NUM_WINS <- factor(slam_top_chart_by_trn$NUM_WINS)\r\nkable(head(slam_top_chart_by_trn, 10))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np_hex<-ggplot(slam_top_chart_by_trn%>% filter(WINNER%in%c(\"Rafael Nadal\",\r\n                                                    \"Novak Djokovic\",\r\n                                                    \"Roger Federer\")),\r\n       aes(TOURNAMENT,NUM_WINS, color=WINNER, group=WINNER))+\r\n  geom_line(size = 0.8)+\r\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = WINNER),\r\n                  data = slam_top_chart_by_trn%>%\r\n                    filter(WINNER%in%c(\"Rafael Nadal\",\r\n                                       \"Novak Djokovic\",\r\n                                       \"Roger Federer\") &\r\n                  TOURNAMENT %in%c(\"Wimbledon\")),\r\n                  size = 5,\r\n                  hjust = 1,\r\n                  vjust = 0.5,\r\n                  nudge_x = 0.7,\r\n                  nudge_y = 0.5,\r\n                  force=2,\r\n                  point.padding = 1,\r\n                  lineheight = 2)+\r\nscale_color_manual(values = c(\"#845EC2\",\"#AF5D00\",\"#008C81\"), name=\"Players\")+\r\n  theme_void()+\r\n  theme_transparent()+\r\n  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),\r\n        legend.position = \"none\")\r\n\r\n## Loading Google fonts (http://www.google.com/fonts)\r\nfont_add_google(\"Gochi Hand\", \"gochi\")\r\n\r\nsticker(p_hex, package=\"GOAT\", p_size=16, s_x=1.08, s_y=0.8, s_width=1.5, s_height=1,\r\n        filename=here(\"Figures\",\"st_1.png\"), h_fill=\"#B0A8B9\", h_color=\"#f39c12\",\r\n        p_color = \"#926C00\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich generates this sticker:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Toughness\r\nI was also curious to use data on Mental Toughness. One important preditor of being a winner in tennis is your mental toughness. This is a rating that compares players in pressure situations:\r\n\\[Mental Toughness Rating = \\frac{Mental Points Won}{Mental Points Lost}\\] Mental Points are weighted pressure situations: Mental Point = 2* Best-of-3 Deciding Set + 4 * Best-of-5 Deciding Set + 2 * Final Match + Non-Deciding Set Tie-Break + 2 * Deciding Set Tie Break\r\nData on mental toughness was downloaded here.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(data.table)\r\nlibrary(here)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nmt<-fread(here(\"Data\",\"MentalToughness.csv\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrank\r\nname\r\ncountry_name\r\nrating\r\n1\r\nNovak Djokovic\r\nSerbia\r\n2.296\r\n2\r\nBjorn Borg\r\nSweden\r\n2.278\r\n3\r\nRod Laver\r\nAustralia\r\n2.152\r\n4\r\nKei Nishikori\r\nJapan\r\n2.031\r\n5\r\nPete Sampras\r\nUnited States\r\n2.000\r\n6\r\nJohn McEnroe\r\nUnited States\r\n1.995\r\n7\r\nRafael Nadal\r\nSpain\r\n1.970\r\n8\r\nAndy Murray\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n1.941\r\n9\r\nThomas Muster\r\nAustria\r\n1.937\r\n10\r\nJimmy Connors\r\nUnited States\r\n1.901\r\n\r\nIndeed, we can see from the table that Djokovic, represented in the map by Serbia, has the highest score on mental toughness. well…not always, though\r\n\r\nI wanted to build a stylized map with the score.\r\n\r\n\r\n# let´s do a sticker on mental toughness\r\n\r\nmt<-mt %>%\r\nmutate(iso3=countrycode(country_name, origin=\"country.name\",destination =  \"iso3c\"))\r\n\r\n# grabbing world data\r\n\r\ndata(World)\r\n\r\n# checking coordinate system\r\n\r\nst_crs(World)\r\n\r\n#changing to Robinson system\r\n\r\nworld_rob<-st_transform(World, \"+proj=robin +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs\")\r\n\r\n#checking again coordinates\r\n\r\nst_crs(world_rob)\r\n\r\n# joining data with shape file\r\n\r\nsetnames(world_rob, \"iso_a3\", \"ISO3\")\r\nmt_map<-left_join(mt, world_rob, by=\"ISO3\")\r\n\r\nst_geometry(mt_map) <- mt_map$geometry\r\n\r\nmap_m <- ggplot()+\r\n  geom_sf(data = mt_map %>% filter(continent%in%\"Europe\" & !ISO3%in%\"RUS\"),\r\n          mapping = aes(fill = rating),\r\n          color = \"white\", size = 0.1) +\r\n  theme_minimal()+\r\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option=\"magma\")+\r\n  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),\r\n        axis.text = element_blank(),\r\n        axis.ticks = element_blank(),\r\n        axis.line = element_blank(),\r\n      legend.key.height = unit(0.3, 'cm'),\r\n      legend.key.size = unit(0.1, 'cm'))\r\n\r\nmap_hex<-ggdraw(map_m)\r\n\r\nsticker(map_hex, package=\"MENTAL\", p_size=20, s_x=1.08, s_y=0.94, s_width=2, s_height=1.4,\r\n        filename=here(\"Figures\",\"map.png\"), h_fill=\"#B0A8B9\", h_color=\"#f39c12\",\r\n        p_color = \"black\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the end:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReady to Play??\r\nEnjoy!

Source: Towards Data Science\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMathematics, Intuition and Artificial Inteligence\r\nIn December 2021, a paper was published in Nature, showing how machine-learning tools can be used to guide the intuition of mathematicians. The paper particularly outlines a framework for how artificial inteligence and mathematicians can work together for advancing the field of pure mathematics and make powerful contributions to open problems. Two fields are particularly the focus of the paper: 1. the algebraic and geometric structure of knots and the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups. The paper is quite interesting and it raises a lot of issues. One is concerned with the very field of mathematics and the concept of intuition.\r\nIn fact, the role of computational power, data and programs is becoming important for all fields. It is definitely shaping how we are currently developing knowledge in the 21st Century. It is an important and fast shift. In demography, for instance, increased computer power has definitely enabled to advance so many topics and opened other research avenues. I often feel that we are more and more becoming data scientists and programming has become more essential for our everyday tasks. Use of different sources of data (cite monica nad diego) as well as big data have also inflood demographic reasearch.\r\nHowever, as much as I value and consider this an important advancement, I cannot stop but wonder how will this shift shape the way we do, think and interpret research. In an area where we don´t have “cursed curves”, but “live curves”, how can we find a balance where knowledge is traceable? Who is held accountable for producing knowledge that often guides policy and informs important human phenomena? In order to have a brief but provocative discussion on this, we have to resort, as usual, to philosophy, and start asking some fundamental questions.\r\nWhat is Mathematics?\r\nLet´s start first with what is Mathematics and how could the use of AI or machine learning tools affect the very concept of the field.\r\nWhat is Intuition for Mathematicians?\r\nA second important, and related question concerns the role of intuition for mathematicians. Intuition is a tricky concept and that is a topic on its own - maybe for another post : ). But for mathematicians it has a more specific concept - which is key. To approach the topic I will recover the very notion of proof and how mathematicians go about making proofs, so that we can dive into the topic in a more “practical way”.\r\nIn one another part of my website I mention Kevin Buzzard on Proof and this talk at Collège de France on November 15, 2021, Professor and Mathematician Kevin Buzzard prompts the topic of “what is proof?”, within the field of Philosophy of Mathematical Practice. This sets the tone for what actually is a mathematical proof. There are other problems that he mentions to take stock of the issue of proof itself as a scientific practice and its validity, especifically in a field where this is so essential such as mathematics. Another interesting topic he raises are the differences between human proof and computer proof. So how do mathematicians use their intuition?\r\nIs Mathematics still Mathematics when not “Human”?\r\nNow this all raises the question of is Mathematics still Mathematics when not solely “human”. Are we “humanizing” AI or is it mathematizing us?\r\n–VDL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
