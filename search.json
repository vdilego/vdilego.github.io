In 2018, I joined as a research scientist the Health and Longevity research group (HELO), headed by Dr. Marc Luy, at the Vienna Institute of Demography at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, part of the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (IIASA,OeAW,University of Vienna). In the framework of the ERC project Levels and Trends of Health Expectancy: Understanding its Measurement and Estimation Sensitivity, I mainly perform sensitivity analysis of healthy life expectancy indicators regarding different measurement and estimation methods.\r\nI am also one of the Editors of the Vienna Yearbook of Population Research (VYPR). Feel free to reach out regarding submissions! I hold a bachelor degree in Social Sciences with a minor in Philosophy from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Faculty of Philosophy and Human Sciences (FAFICH/UFMG), and a Master’s and Doctorate degree in Demography from the Centre of Development and Regional Planning at the Faculty of Economic Sciences (CEDEPLAR,FACE/UFMG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The books that made up the series were published between 1829 and 1847. There are many orders to read them and a debate among scholars on what order should the books be read. I am following the one suggested by this reading group here that used most of the recommendations from William Hobart Royce’s book Balzac as He Should Be Read. I chose this one after a long search due to the fact that the group was more enthusiastic and not so much literary critics. I wanted to have a deeper feeling for French society and institutions in, but, most importantly, I wanted to partake in a long, long, long, reading project. I adore long books, and tend to hold on to stories that unravell slowly and painfully (I know - tough to understand why anyone would like such a thing). Everytime I finish one of these books, however, I feel a tremendous empty feeling (junky vibes anyone?) and was seeking an experience that would allow for a more prolonged feeling of being inside a story and avoid the blues. If you share the same feeling as I do or are just interested in my analysis of each story just stay tuned for more updates on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Our most recent published work was An indirect method to monitor the fraction of people ever infected with COVID-19: An application to the United States. In this work we propose a complementary approach that combines estimated (1) infection fatality rates (IFR) using a Bayesian melding SEIR model with (2) reported case-fatality rates (CFR), in order to indirectly estimate the fraction of people ever infected (from the total population) and detected (from the ever infected). We apply the technique to the U.S. due to their remarkable regional diversity and because at the moment of our analysis (January 2021) the country counted with almost a quarter of all global confirmed cases and deaths. You can find all the codes to replicate the study here.\r\nWe also performed an extensive estimation for all countries in the world in a working paper of the Vienna University of Technology, Institute of Statistics and Mathematical Methods in Economics, Research Group Economics, Vienna entitled How many lives can be saved?

The Formal Demography Working Group aims to bring together formal demography scholars and those interested in formal demography to discuss recent and classic work, brainstorm new ideas, and to foster new collaborations. If you are interested, follow our group website and subscribe to the mail list here and check out our github.\r\nOur goal with the group is to bring an international community of scholars together with formal demography as the focus on creating a supportive and inclusive environment to learn and encourage people to work with formal methods. We also discuss the past, present and future of formal demography.\r\nWithin formal demography, I am particularly interested in stable population theory, redistribution of deaths and exploring lifetable relationships. I am also interested in Tempo effects in mortality and the sensitvity of life expectancy as an indicator, as recently addressed in this publication. Stay tuned for further developments!

However, it is difficult to explain the process because morbidity by sex differs considerably across domains of health, age groups, social contexts and severity level. In addition, women and men report differently their health in surveys, making it cumbersome to understand whether what drives the paradox is a higher female morbidity or male mortality, a different reporting behaviour, or all of those aspects together.\r\nMy research focuses on the role of measurement and estimation in explaining the paradox. This relates to the different health dimensions, how mortality and morbidity are estimated and data gaps by gender.\r\nBelow you can find some of my published work on this topic.

For me, this is representative of the long-standing discussion on the “danger” of knowledge and how learning how to think philosophically (i.e., learning how to think in the first place) and thus pose questions to established institutions and ways of thinking and living can be considered a threat by those who gatekeep the status quo. I am a researcher scientist who is open-minded and seeks knowledge in a barrier-free manner; who constantly feels dissatisfied by the current level of knowledge and attempts to go beyond disciplinary walls (the gatekeepers of our contemporary world).

      "contents": "\r\nSource: Wikimedia Commons, public domain image\r\nbody {\r\ntext-align: justify}\r\nAlbert Einstein is one of the most influential scientists in the 20th Century. He inspired me a lot with his unusual quirks and interesting views and quotes on mathematics and reality - which spoke highly to me, a person who always thought was really bad at math. “Do not worry too much about your difficulties in mathematics, I can assure you that mine are still greater” is one of these quotes that can be interpreted in many ways, but for me it meant that I could, in fact, pursue my interest in this challenging field. I also think that they way mathematics is taught is, in many ways, disconnected from its inherent creativity and abstract thinking. Eugenia Cheng mentions in her book The Art of Logic in an Illogical World how we have a misconception around mathematics that stems from thinking it as a set of rules you follow to get a right answer, which is usually a number. But that real mathematics - or the one you can do when in research - is a “world to explore, discover and understand: the logical world”. Content is important, of course, and Ian Stewart in his Foreword of the 1990 Edition of How to Solve it, by George Pólya, mentions that the key to avoid seeing mathematics as only a set of rules is to grasp “problem-solving as a practical tool, part of the mathematician’s mental equipment, but not as an end in itself”. This view endorses some of methods by George Pólya where one can guess new results from known results: specialization, generalization and analogy, which are part of “plausible reasoning”, like the Figure below.\r\nSource: Wikimedia Commons, Krishnachandranvn at English Wikipedia. This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unportedlicense.eGeorge Pólya also has a set of rules of thought and strategies to think like a mathematician in four steps, as explained below:\r\nSource: How to Solve itI will update here posts about some views, readings, and stuff I am working on leisurely. For now, I will just go home with another quote by my friend Albert: “Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas”.\r\n                                             - VDL\r\nKevin Buzzard on Proof\r\nIn this talk at Collège de France on November 15, 2021, Professor and Mathematician Kevin Buzzard prompts the topic of “what is proof?”, within the field of Philosophy of Mathematical Practice.\r\n\r\nHe starts provocatively by discussing contradictory results; or what happens when there are papers in respected journals that contradict each other? Arguably, there is a formal definition of mathematical proofs in such a way that every argument is either valid or invalid. So how could there be contradictions?\r\nOne topic he mentions that struck me is connected to the recent rational solutions found to a famously 40-year long difficult mathematical problem Cursed Curve. Apparently, it is the equation:\r\n\\[y^4 + 5x^4 − 6x^2y^2 + 6x^3z + 26x^2yz + 10xy^2z − 10y^3z − 32x^2z^2\\\\ − 40xyz^2 + 24y^2z^2 + 32xz^3 − 16yz^3 = 0\\]\r\n(Now you know how to properly curse someone in mathematical language). The issue is that the proof uses a closed-source computer system (magma). How can one call proof something that is closed and difficult to verify by the community at large? There are other problems that he mentions to take stock of the issue of proof itself as a scientific practice and its validity, especifically in a field where this is so essential such as mathematics. Another interesting topic he raises are the differences between human proof and computer proof.\r\nIn my view, I started to think of the role of computational power and programs in how we develop knowledge in other fields. In demography, for instance, increased computer power has definitely enabled to advance so many topics and opened other research avenues. I often feel that we are more and more becoming data scientists and programming has become more essential (I think of me as a graduate student without previous excel use and now I am here writing on the webpage I created using Rstudio and Githhub) for our everyday tasks. As much as I value and consider this an important advancement, I cannot stop but wonder how will computer power shape the way we do, think and interpret research. In an area where we don´t have “cursed curves”, but “live curves”, how can we find a balance where knowledge is traceable? Who is held accountable for producing knowledge that often guides policy and informs important human phenomena?\r\n                                             - VDL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nSource:Own elaboration\r\nbody {\r\ntext-align: justify}\r\nI am currently exploring the revivorship function as part of demographic models of lifesaving as developed by Vaupel (1986), Vaupel and Yashin (1987) and recently extended and discussed by Schmertmann (2020). The concept of force of mortality \\(\\mu_x\\) is coupled with the notion of lifesaving \\(\\lambda_x\\). This construct allows for assessing the formal relationships between survivorship (\\(l_x\\)), density distribution of deaths (\\(d_x\\)) and life expectancy (\\(e_x\\)) between two diﬀerent regimes in a dynamic way, instead of focusing on comparing different mortality trajectories as proposed by Pollard (1982) or on the density distribution of deaths (\\(d_x\\)), as in Bergeron-Boucher et al. (2017) or Basellini and Camarda (2019). In a context of mortality improvement, the new force of mortality \\(\\mu_x^*\\) can be seen as a decomposition of the old mortality regime \\(\\mu_x\\) plus a force of lifesaving \\(\\lambda_x\\). At each age, a proportion \\(\\delta\\) of individuals who would have died are now resuscitated and given another chance or another ticket to life (Wachter 2005). The process can be mathematically described by a factorial reminiscent of the Poisson distribution, resulting in a revivorship function that estimates the probability that an individual will be given \\(n\\) chances (will be resuscitated) \\(i\\) times by age \\(x\\). It is also possible to decompose life expectancy diﬀerentials into gains in \\(\\tau_i\\) life years at each averted death state. This approach can provide valuable insights into how the lifesaving process unfolds, including its eﬀect on life expectancy and on tempo eﬀects.\r\nRationale\r\nThe demographic model of lifesaving developed by (Vaupel and Yashin 1987) combines the concept of force of mortality \\(\\mu_x\\) with the notion of lifesaving \\(\\lambda_x\\), wherein mortality improvement can be conceived as both a reduction on the force of mortality \\(\\mu_x\\) or as an increase in the force of lifesaving \\(\\lambda_x\\). Hence, progress in mortality can be reviewed through the link between the old and new mortality regimes:\r\n\\[\\begin{equation}  \r\n\\mu^*_x = \\mu_x-\\lambda_x\r\n\\end{equation}\\]\r\nWhere \\(\\mu^*_x\\) is the new mortality regime and \\(\\mu_x\\) the old one. This lifesaving force \\(\\lambda_x\\) can lead to many lives being saved once, more than once or none at all. The effect of saving lives on life expectancy depends on both the number of deaths at various ages and on the number of additional years of life a resuscitated person might have. The number of times deaths were averted in order to achieve a given mortality regime can be described through the “revivorship” function, defined as:\r\n\\[\\begin{equation}  \r\nl^*_x= l_x+l_ix+l_2x+...\r\n\\end{equation}\\]\r\nAnd that the chances of repeated resuscitation are:\r\n\\[\\begin{equation}  \r\nl_ix= l_x\\Lambda{x^i/i!}, i= 0,1,2,...\r\n\\end{equation}\\]\r\nWhere: \\[\\begin{equation}  \r\n\\Lambda(x)= \\int_{0}^{x}\\lambda(t) dt \r\n\\end{equation}\\]\r\nWith: \\[\\begin{equation}  \r\n\\Lambda(x)= \\ln(l^*(x)/l(x))\r\n\\end{equation}\\]\r\nFurther, it is possible to establish the relationship between survival under the new and old regimes through:\r\n\\[\\begin{equation}  \r\nl^*_{(x)}= l_{(x)}+l_x\\Lambda_{(x)}+[l_{(x)}\\Lambda_{(x)}^2]/2+...+[l_{(x)}\\Lambda_{(x)}^i]/i!\r\n\\end{equation}\\]\r\nFrom which we can decompose the value of life expectancy into \\(\\tau_i\\): \\[\\begin{equation}  \r\n\\tau_{i}= \\int_{0}^{\\omega}l_i(x) dx =\r\n\\int_{0}^{\\omega}l_{(x)}\\Lambda_{(x)}^i dx/i!. \r\n\\end{equation}\\]\r\nWith \\[\\begin{equation}  \r\n\\Lambda(x)= \\ln(l^*(x)/l(x))\r\n\\end{equation}\\]\r\nThese relationships can be very interesting to explore in order to evaluate how the survivorship function changes in the process of lifesaving and how one could interpret mortality transition in different ways.
