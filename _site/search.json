      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\nbody {\r\ntext-align: justify}\r\nI am a demographer researching issues related to health and mortality, specifically the methodological challenges and gender gaps in mortality, as well as in the longevity of specific subgroups and selection in mortality studies. In 2018, I joined as a research scientist the Health and Longevity research group (HELO), headed by Dr. Marc Luy, at the Vienna Institute of Demography at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, part of the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (IIASA,OeAW,University of Vienna). In the framework of the ERC project Levels and Trends of Health Expectancy: Understanding its Measurement and Estimation Sensitivity, I mainly perform sensitivity analysis of healthy life expectancy indicators regarding different measurement and estimation methods.\r\nI am also one of the Editors of the Vienna Yearbook of Population Research (VYPR). Feel free to reach out regarding submissions! I hold a bachelor degree in Social Sciences with a minor in Philosophy from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Faculty of Philosophy and Human Sciences (FAFICH/UFMG), and a Master’s and Doctorate degree in Demography from the Centre of Development and Regional Planning at the Faculty of Economic Sciences (CEDEPLAR,FACE/UFMG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nSource: Wikimedia Commons, public domain image\r\nbody {\r\ntext-align: justify}\r\nThe Human Comedy is a vast series of some 90 novels and novellas by Honoré de Balzac, known in the original French as La Comédie Humaine. The books that made up the series were published between 1829 and 1847. There are many orders to read them and a debate among scholars on what order should the books be read. I am following the one suggested by this reading group here that used most of the recommendations from William Hobart Royce’s book Balzac as He Should Be Read. I chose this one after a long search due to the fact that the group was more enthusiastic and not so much literary critics. I wanted to have a deeper feeling for French society and institutions in, but, most importantly, I wanted to partake in a long, long, long, reading project. I adore long books, and tend to hold on to stories that unravell slowly and painfully (I know - tough to understand why anyone would like such a thing). Everytime I finish one of these books, however, I feel a tremendous empty feeling (junky vibes anyone?) and was seeking an experience that would allow for a more prolonged feeling of being inside a story and avoid the blues. If you share the same feeling as I do or are just interested in my analysis of each story just stay tuned for more updates on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nSource: Own elaboration, extracted from Sánchez-Romero et al., 2021\r\nbody {\r\ntext-align: justify}\r\nMy research with colleagues Miguel Sánchez-Romero, Alexia Fürnkranz-Prskawetz, and Bernardo Lanza Queiroz on COVID-19 has focused on indirectly estimating the proportion of people ever infected, the interpretation of the case-fatality rate (CFR), and estimating the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing deaths. Our most recent published work was An indirect method to monitor the fraction of people ever infected with COVID-19: An application to the United States. In this work we propose a complementary approach that combines estimated (1) infection fatality rates (IFR) using a Bayesian melding SEIR model with (2) reported case-fatality rates (CFR), in order to indirectly estimate the fraction of people ever infected (from the total population) and detected (from the ever infected). We apply the technique to the U.S. due to their remarkable regional diversity and because at the moment of our analysis (January 2021) the country counted with almost a quarter of all global confirmed cases and deaths. You can find all the codes to replicate the study here.\r\nWe also performed an extensive estimation for all countries in the world in a working paper of the Vienna University of Technology, Institute of Statistics and Mathematical Methods in Economics, Research Group Economics, Vienna entitled How many lives can be saved? A global view on the impact of testing, herd immunity and demographics on COVID-19 fatality rates, where we assess the impact of testing, herd immunity and demographics in COVID-19 Fatality rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I have recently co-organized a working group on Formal Demography together with Monica Alexander (University of Oxford) and Ryohei Mogi (University of Oxford). The Formal Demography Working Group aims to bring together formal demography scholars and those interested in formal demography to discuss recent and classic work, brainstorm new ideas, and to foster new collaborations. If you are interested, follow our group website and subscribe to the mail list here and check out our github.\r\nOur goal with the group is to bring an international community of scholars together with formal demography as the focus on creating a supportive and inclusive environment to learn and encourage people to work with formal methods. We also discuss the past, present and future of formal demography.\r\nWithin formal demography, I am particularly interested in stable population theory, redistribution of deaths and exploring lifetable relationships. I am also interested in Tempo effects in mortality and the sensitvity of life expectancy as an indicator, as recently addressed in this publication. Stay tuned for further developments! A bunch of stuff can be found in my github account as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nSource: Own elaboration, extracted from Di Lego et al., 2019\r\nbody {\r\ntext-align: justify}\r\nThere is consistent evidence that women live longer than men at all ages, but spend a higher proportion of their total life expectancy in poorer health, a phenomenon described as the “male-female health-survival paradox” or the “gender paradox in health and mortality”. However, it is difficult to explain the process because morbidity by sex differs considerably across domains of health, age groups, social contexts and severity level. In addition, women and men report differently their health in surveys, making it cumbersome to understand whether what drives the paradox is a higher female morbidity or male mortality, a different reporting behaviour, or all of those aspects together.\r\nMy research focuses on the role of measurement and estimation in explaining the paradox. This relates to the different health dimensions, how mortality and morbidity are estimated and data gaps by gender.\r\nBelow you can find some of my published work on this topic.

For me, this is representative of the long-standing discussion on the “danger” of knowledge and how learning how to think philosophically (i.e., learning how to think in the first place) and thus pose questions to established institutions and ways of thinking and living can be considered a threat by those who gatekeep the status quo. I am a researcher scientist who is open-minded and seeks knowledge in a barrier-free manner; who constantly feels dissatisfied by the current level of knowledge and attempts to go beyond disciplinary walls (the gatekeepers of our contemporary world). Feel free to tell me I am wrong and let’s build a better world together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nSource: Wikimedia Commons, public domain image\r\nbody {\r\ntext-align: justify}\r\nAlbert Einstein is one of the most influential scientists in the 20th Century. He inspired me a lot with his unusual quirks and interesting views and quotes on mathematics and reality - which spoke highly to me, a person who always thought was really bad at math. “Do not worry too much about your difficulties in mathematics, I can assure you that mine are still greater” is one of these quotes that can be interpreted in many ways, but for me it meant that I could, in fact, pursue my interest in this challenging field. I also think that they way mathematics is taught is, in many ways, disconnected from its inherent creativity and abstract thinking. Eugenia Cheng mentions in her book The Art of Logic in an Illogical World how we have a misconception around mathematics that stems from thinking it as a set of rules you follow to get a right answer, which is usually a number. But that real mathematics - or the one you can do when in research - is a “world to explore, discover and understand: the logical world”. Content is important, of course, and Ian Stewart in his Foreword of the 1990 Edition of How to Solve it, by George Pólya, mentions that the key to avoid seeing mathematics as only a set of rules is to grasp “problem-solving as a practical tool, part of the mathematician’s mental equipment, but not as an end in itself”. This view endorses some of methods by George Pólya where one can guess new results from known results: specialization, generalization and analogy, which are part of “plausible reasoning”, like the Figure below.\r\nSource: Wikimedia Commons, Krishnachandranvn at English Wikipedia.

For now, I will just go home with another quote by my friend Albert: “Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
