abstract = {Age-at-death distributions provide an informative description of the mortality pattern of a population but have generally been neglected for modelling and forecasting mortality. In this paper, we use the distribution of deaths to model and forecast adult mortality. Specifically, we introduce a relational model that relates a fixed ‘standard' to a series of observed distributions by a transformation of the age axis. The proposed Segmented Transformation Age-at-death Distributions (STAD) model is parsimonious and efficient: using only three parameters, it captures and disentangles mortality developments in terms of shifting and compression dynamics. Additionally, mortality forecasts can be derived from parameter extrapolation using time-series models. We illustrate our method and compare it with the Lee–Carter model and variants for females in four high-longevity countries. We show that the STAD fits the observed mortality pattern very well, and that its forecasts are more accurate and optimistic than the Lee–Carter variants.},

abstract = {Averting deaths may either increase or reduce life disparity, as measured by e-dagger. The sign of the effect depends on the age at which the deaths are averted. There may, depending on the entropy of the life table, be an age such that averting deaths before that age reduces disparity, but averting deaths after that age increases disparity. This age separates “early” from “late” deaths (in terms of their effect on disparity). Investigate the factors determining this threshold age. If life table entropy is less than one, a unique threshold age separating early and late deaths always exists. If life table entropy is greater than one, averting deaths at any age increases disparity. If entropy equals one, averting deaths at age zero has no effect, but averting a death at any age after zero increases disparity.},

@article{Vallin2004,
abstract = {Abdel Omran's 1971 theory of "Epidemiologic Transition" was the first attempt to account for the extraordinary advances in health care made in industrialized countries since the 18th century. In the framework of the Demographic Transition, it implied a general convergence of life expectancies toward a limit imposed by the new epidemiological features of modern societies. However, important failures, occurred in the past decades (mainly the health crisis in Eastern Europe and AIDS in Africa), seem to have stopped that process of convergence. In fact such failures do not really contradict the theory. The latter is much more ruined by the unexpected dramatic improvement in the field of cardiovascular disease experienced since the seventies, which results in a new step of a more general process. On the basis of the broader concept of "Health Transition" initiated by Julio Frenk et al., the present paper tries to rethink the full process in term of divergence/convergence sequences inferred by successive major changes in health technologies and strategies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.},

@article{Mitra1979,
abstract = {A decline in mortality can be described as a process according to which the earlier forces of mortality become what has been defined here as the forces of debility. The main thesis is that individuals contract debilitating conditions now with the same force that used to result in deaths in the past. The difference in the two situations is that in the latter period, a certain proportion of the population can recover and thus escape death. Based on these assumptions, the relationships between the initial and the resulting life table functions have been developed in this paper. Among other things, the relative gain in life expectancy has been found to be inversely related to its initial value. Further, interesting results are obtained when a fixed proportion of the population can manage to survive a debilitating condition only once, only twice and so on. The limiting situation has been found to be equivalent to one in which the initial forces of mortality at all ages are reduced by a constant proportion. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {A general algorithm for the decomposition of differences between two values of an aggregate demographic measure in respect to age and other dimensions is proposed. It assumes that the aggregate measure is computed from similar matrices of discrete demographic data for two populations under comparison. The algorithm estimates the effects of replacement for each elementary cell of one matrix by respective cell of another matrix. Application of the algorithm easily leads to the known formula for the age-decomposition of differences between two life expectancies. It also allows to develop new formulae for differences between healthy life expectancies. In the latter case, each age-component is split further into effects of mortality and effects of health. The application of the algorithm enables a numerical decomposition of the differences between total fertility rates and between parity progression ratios by age of the mother and parity. Empirical examples are based on mortality data from the USA, the UK, West Germany, and Poland and on fertility data from Russia. {\textcopyright} Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.},

@article{Aburto2018,
abstract = {Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have experienced considerable instability in mortality since the 1960s. Long periods of stagnating life expectancy were followed by rapid increases in life expectancy and, in some cases, even more rapid declines, before more recent periods of improvement. These trends have been well documented, but to date, no study has comprehensively explored trends in lifespan variation. We improved such analyses by incorporating life disparity as a health indicator alongside life expectancy, examining trends since the 1960s for 12 countries from the region. Generally, life disparity was high and fluctuated strongly over the period. For nearly 30 of these years, life expectancy and life disparity varied independently of each other, largely because mortality trends ran in opposite directions over different ages. Furthermore, we quantified the impact of large classes of diseases on life disparity trends since 1994 using a newly harmonized cause-of-death time series for eight countries in the region. Mortality patterns in CEE countries were heterogeneous and ran counter to the common patterns observed in most developed countries. They contribute to the discussion about life expectancy disparity by showing that expansion/compression levels do not necessarily mean lower/higher life expectancy or mortality deterioration/improvements.},

abstract = {In this article, we investigate the effect of demography on wealth inequality. We propose an economic growth model with overlapping generations in which individuals are altruistic towards their children and differ with respect to the age of their parent. We denote the age gap between the parent and their child as generational gap. The introduction of the generational gap allows us to analyze wealth inequality not only across cohorts but also within cohorts. Our model predicts that a decline in fertility raises wealth inequality within cohorts and, simultaneously, it reduces inequality at the population level (across cohorts). In contrast, increases in life expectancy result in a non-monotonic effect on wealth inequality by age and across cohorts.},

This paper explores the differences between life expectancies at a given time (the gap) and the time required for period life expectancy to reach the current level of cohort life expectancy (the lag). Additionally, to understand the disparity between the two life expectancies we identify and compare age-specific contributions to change in life expectancy. Using mortality models and historical data for Sweden, we examine the effect of mortality changes over time. Our results indicate that the widening of the gap between the two life expectancies is primarily a consequence of the dramatic mortality decline at older ages that occurred during the twentieth century. These results imply that the divergence between the two measures is likely to become even greater in the future as reductions in deaths are concentrated at older ages.},

Although general in its purposes, the package is specifically tailored to demographers, actuaries, epidemiologists, and geneticists who may be interested in using a practical tool for smoothing mortality data over ages and/or years. The total number of deaths over a specified age-and year-interval is assumed to be Poisson-distributed, and P-splines and generalized linear array models are employed as a suitable regression methodology. Extra-Poisson variation can also be accommodated. Structured in an S3 object orientation system, MortalitySmooth has two main functions which fit the data and define two classes of objects: Mort1Dsmooth and Mort2Dsmooth. The methods for these classes (print, summary, plot, predict, and residuals) are also included. These features make it easy for users to extract and manipulate the outputs. In addition, a collection of mortality data is provided. This paper provides an overview of the design, aims, and principles of MortalityS-mooth, as well as strategies for applying it and extending its use.},

The variance captures the compositional change.

With these estimates of the degree of population heterogeneity it is possible to adjust comparisons of mortality risks across populations for the effects of population heterogeneity, differential mortality selection, and different age trajectories of the force of mortality. These methods are demonstrated by applying a variety of standard assumptions about the age trajectory of the force of mortality to the analysis of a broad range of cohort mortality data for the U.S. and Swedish populations. The estimates of the degree of heterogeneity, produced under all of the selected force of mortality models, consistently indicated a considerable degree of heterogeneity in mortality risks. {\textcopyright} 1981 Population Association of America.},

abstract = {Previous research found evidence for a transition from mortality compression (declining lifespan variability) to mortality delay (increasing ages at death) in low-mortality countries. We specifically assessed the year at which increases in life expectancy at birth transitioned from being predominantly due to mortality compression to being predominantly due to mortality delay in 26 European countries, Japan, and the United States of America (USA), 1950–2014. To unsmoothed age- and sex-specific death rates from the Human Mortality Database, we applied the CoDe (compression and delay) mortality model. Among women, the transition first occurred in the USA around 1950, then in North-Western Europe (1955–1970) and Southern Europe (1970–1975), and still later in Eastern Europe. Among men, the transition occurred about 10 years later and is still incomplete in Eastern Europe. We identified four stages: (1) predominance of compression mainly due to mortality declines at young ages, (2) declining importance of mortality compression due to the decreasing impact of mortality declines at young ages, (3) delay becomes predominant due to the increasing impact of mortality delay and the counterbalancing effects of mortality compression/expansion at different ages, and (4) strong predominance of delay accompanied by strong adult mortality declines and declining compression at old ages. Our results suggest that life expectancy and maximum lifespan will increase further. With mortality delay, premature mortality and old-age mortality are shifting towards older ages.},

abstract = {Theoretical models of mortality selection have great utility in explaining otherwise puzzling phenomena. The most famous example may be the Black-White mortality crossover: at old ages, Blacks outlive Whites, presumably because few frail Blacks survive to old ages while some frail Whites do. Yet theoretical models of unidimensional heterogeneity, or frailty, do not speak to the most common empirical situation for mortality researchers: the case in which some important population heterogeneity is observed and some is not. I show that, when one dimension of heterogeneity is observed and another is unobserved, neither the observed nor the unobserved dimension need behave as classic frailty models predict. For example, in a multidimensional model, mortality selection can increase the proportion of survivors who are disadvantaged, or “frail,” and can lead Black survivors to be more frail than Whites, along some dimensions of disadvantage. Transferring theoretical results about unidimensional heterogeneity to settings with both observed and unobserved heterogeneity produces misleading inferences about mortality disparities. The unusually flexible behavior of individual dimensions of multidimensional heterogeneity creates previously unrecognized challenges for empirically testing selection models of disparities, such as models of mortality crossovers.},

@article{Bergeron-Boucher2017a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Mortality trends for subpopulations, e.g., countries in a region or provinces in a country, tend to change similarly over time. However, when forecasting subpopulations independently, the forecast mortality trends often diverge. These divergent trends emerge from an inability of different forecast models to offer population-specific forecasts that are consistent with one another. Nondivergent forecasts between similar populations are often referred to as "coherent." METHODS We propose a new forecasting method that addresses the coherence problem for subpopulations, based on Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) of the life table distribution of deaths. We adapt existing coherent and noncoherent forecasting models to CoDa and compare their results. RESULTS We apply our coherent method to the female mortality of 15 Western European countries and show that our proposed strategy would have improved the forecast accuracy for many of the selected countries. The results also show that the CoDa adaptation of commonly used models allows the rates of mortality improvements (RMIs) to change over time. CONTRIBUTION This study opens a discussion about the use of age-specific mortality indicators other than death rates to forecast mortality. The results show that the use of life table deaths and CoDa leads to less biased forecasts than more commonly used forecasting models based on the extrapolation of death rates. To the authors' knowledge, the present study is the first attempt to forecast coherently the distribution of deaths of many populations.},

abstract = {In this article, we consider the evolution of the post-age-60 mortality curve in the United Kingdom and its impact on the pricing of the risk associated with aggregate mortality improvements over time: so-called longevity risk. We introduce a two-factor stochastic model for the development of this curve through time. The first factor affects mortality-rate dynamics at all ages in the same way, whereas the second factor affects mortality-rate dynamics at higher ages much more than at lower ages. The article then examines the pricing of longevity bonds with different terms to maturity referenced to different cohorts. We find that longevity risk over relatively short time horizons is very low, but at horizons in excess of ten years it begins to pick up very rapidly. A key component of the article is the proposal and development of a method for calculating the market risk-adjusted price of a longevity bond. The proposed adjustment includes not just an allowance for the underlying stochastic mortality, but also makes an allowance for parameter risk. We utilize the pricing information contained in the November 2004 European Investment Bank longevity bond to make inferences about the likely market prices of the risks in the model. Based on these, we investigate how future issues might be priced to ensure an absence of arbitrage between bonds with different characteristics. {\textcopyright} The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2006,.},

abstract = {Unobserved heterogeneity in mortality risk is pervasive and consequential. Mortality deceleration-the slowing of mortality's rise with age-has been considered an important window into heterogeneity that otherwise might be impossible to explore. In this article, I argue that deceleration patterns may reveal surprisingly little about the heterogeneity that putatively produces them. I show that even in a very simple model-one that is composed of just two subpopulations with Gompertz mortality-(1) aggregate mortality can decelerate even while a majority of the cohort is frail; (2) multiple decelerations are possible; and (3) mortality selection can produce acceleration as well as deceleration. Simulations show that these patterns are plausible in model cohorts that in the aggregate resemble cohorts in the Human Mortality Database. I argue that these results challenge some conventional heuristics for understanding the relationship between selection and deceleration; undermine certain inferences from deceleration timing to patterns of social inequality; and imply that standard parametric models, assumed to plateau at most once, may sometimes badly misestimate deceleration timing-even by decades. {\textcopyright} 2014 Population Association of America.},

@article{Sobhani2020,
abstract = {Since temperature variables are used in many load forecasting models, the quality of historical temperature data is crucial to the forecast accuracy. The raw data collected by local weather stations and archived by government agencies often include many missing values and incorrect readings, and thus cannot be used directly by load forecasters. As a result, many power companies today purchase data from commercial weather service vendors. Such quality-controlled data may still have many defects, but many load forecasters have been using them in full faith. This paper proposes a novel temperature anomaly detection methodology that makes use of the local load information collected by power companies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through two public datasets: one from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 and the other from ISO New England. The results show that the accuracy of the final load forecasts can be enhanced by removing the detected observations from the original input data.},

@article{Camarda2019,
abstract = {Background: Mortality can be forecast by means of parametric models, principal component methods, and smoothing approaches. These methods either impose rigid modeling structures or produce implausible outcomes. Objective: We propose a novel approach for forecasting mortality that combines a well established smoothing model and prior demographic information. We constrain future smooth mortality patterns to lie within a range of valid age proﬁles and time trends, both computed from observed patterns. Methods: Within a P-spline framework, we enforce shape constraints through an asymmetric penalty approach on forecast mortality. Moreover, we properly integrate infant mortality in a smoothing framework so that the mortality forecast covers the whole age range. Results: The proposed model outperforms the plain smoothing approach as well as commonly used methodologies while retaining all the desirable properties that demographers expect from a forecasting method, e.g., smooth and plausible age proﬁles and time trends. We illustrate the proposed approach to mortality data for Danish females and US males. Conclusions: The proposed methodology offers a new paradigm in forecasting mortality, and it is an ideal balance between pure statistical methodology and traditional demographic models. Prior knowledge about mortality development can be conveniently included in the approach, leading to large ﬂexibility. The combination of powerful statistical methodology and prior demographic information makes the proposed model suitable for forecasting mortality in most demographic scenarios.

abstract = {As world populations age, the analysis of demographic mortality data and demographic predictions of future mortality have met with increasing interest. The study of mortality patterns and the forecasting of future mortality with its associated impacts on social welfare, health care, and societal planning has become a more pressing issue. An ideal set of data to study patterns of change in long-term mortality is the well-known historical Swedish cohort mortality data, because of its high quality and long span of more than two centuries. We explore the use of functional data analysis to model these data and to derive mortality forecasts. Specifically, we address the challenge of flexibly modeling these data while including the effect of the birth year by regarding log-hazard functions, derived from observed cohort lifetables, as random functions. A functional model for the analysis of these cohort log-hazard functions, extending functional principal component approaches by introducing time-varying eigenfunctions, is found to adequately address these challenges. The associated analysis of the dependency structure of the cohort log-hazard functions leads to the concept of time-varying principal components of mortality. We then extend this analysis to mortality forecasting, by combining prediction of incompletely observed log-hazard functions with functional local extrapolation, and demonstrate these functional approaches for the Swedish cohort mortality data. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Statistical Association.},

abstract = {Inter-individual variance in longevity (or any other demographic outcome) may arise from heterogeneity or from individual stochasticity. Heterogeneity refers to differences among individuals in the demographic rates experienced at a given age or stage. Stochasticity refers to variation due to the random outcome of demographic rates applied to individuals with the same properties. The variance due to individual stochasticity can be calculated from a Markov chain description of the life cycle. The variance due to heterogeneity can be calculated from a multistate model that incorporates the heterogeneity. We show how to use this approach to decompose the variance in longevity into contributions from stochasticity and heterogeneous frailty for male and female cohorts from Sweden (1751–1899), France (1816–1903), and Italy (1872–1899), and also for a selection of period data for the same countries. Heterogeneity in mortality is described by the gamma-Gompertz–Makeham model, in which a gamma distributed “frailty” modifies a baseline Gompertz–Makeham mortality schedule. Model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood for a range of starting ages. The estimates were used to construct an age×frailty-classified matrix model, from which we compute the variance of longevity and its components due to heterogeneous frailty and to individual stochasticity. The estimated fraction of the variance in longevity due to heterogeneous frailty (averaged over time) is less than 10{\%} for all countries and for both sexes. These results suggest that most of the variance in human longevity arises from stochasticity, rather than from heterogeneous frailty.},

abstract = {The life table entropy provides useful information for understanding improvements in mortality and survival in a population. In this paper we take a closer look at the life table entropy and use advanced mathematical methods to provide additional insights for understanding how it relates to changes in mortality and survival. By studying the entropy (H) as a functional, we show that changes in the entropy depend on both the relative change in life expectancy lost due to death (e{\textless}sup{\textgreater}†{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and in life expectancy at birth (e{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). We also show that changes in the entropy can be further linked to improvements in premature and older deaths. We illustrate our methods with empirical data from Latin American countries, which suggests that at high mortality levels declines in H (which are associated with survival increases) linked with larger improvements in e{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, whereas at low mortality levels e{\textless}sup{\textgreater}†{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} made larger contributions to H. We additionally show that among countries with low mortality level, contributions of e{\textless}sup{\textgreater}†{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to changes in the life table entropy resulted from averting early deaths. These findings indicate that future increases in overall survival in low mortality countries will likely result from improvements in e{\textless}sup{\textgreater}†{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

Methods: We obtained data on underlying cause of death from the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden for 1997 and 2014 and used Arriaga's method to decompose life expectancy by age group and 24 causes of death. Results: Decreased mortality from ischemic heart disease had the largest impact on the increased life expectancy of both men and women and on the decreased gender gap in life expectancy. Increased mortality from Alzheimer's disease negatively influenced overall life expectancy, but because of higher female mortality, it also served to decrease the gender gap in life expectancy. The impact of other causes of death, particularly smoking-related causes, decreased in men but increased in women, also reducing the gap in life expectancy. Conclusions: This study shows that a focus on overall changes in life expectancies may hide important differences in age- and cause-specific mortality. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing modifiable lifestyle factors to reduce avoidable mortality.},

A large amount of literature has proposed models to forecast mortality using cross-sectional (period) data instead of longitudinal (cohort) data. As a consequence, decisions are generally based on period life tables and summary measures such as period life expectancy, which reflect hypothetical mortality rather than the mortality actually experienced by a cohort. This study introduces a novel method to forecast cohort mortality and the cohort life expectancy of non-extinct cohorts. The intent is to complete the mortality profile of cohorts born up to 1960. The proposed method is based on the penalized composite link model for ungrouping data.

Males at ages 15 to 40 die at rates that are often three times female levels, but this excess mortality is not the main cause of the life expectancy gap.

Our demographic analysis shows that, up through the early decades of the 20th century, the life expectancy gap largely resulted from excess deaths of infant boys. Afterward, higher mortality among men 60+ became crucial. The higher mortality of males at ages 15 to 40 has played a modest role.
